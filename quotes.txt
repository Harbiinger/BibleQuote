Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?  1 Corinthians 3:16
"I have the right to do anything," you say – but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything" – but I will not be mastered by anything.  1 Corinthians 6:12
Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak.  1 Corinthians 8:9
So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!  1 Corinthians 10:12
